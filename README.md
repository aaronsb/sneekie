# Sneekie

A faithful **terminal** port of *Sneekie* — a snake game written in GW-BASIC in
July 1988 by Herbert Groot Jebbink (HerbySoft) and published on the MSX/MS-DOS
Computer Magazine diskette MCMPC-D2 (no. 25, October 1988).

The original ran in 80×25 text mode and POKE'd characters straight into video
memory. This port keeps that model exactly — a 4000-byte "VRAM" buffer rendered
through the **CP437** character set — so the box-drawing snake, the `♥`/`♣`
food, the `☺` traps, the `◙` pushable stones and the `↑→←` arrow hazards all
look just like 1988, in any modern terminal.

Ported from the [single-page HTML re-creation](https://herbert256.github.io/sneekie/)
of the original `SNEEKIE.BAS` — by Herbert Groot Jebbink, whose source lives at
[github.com/herbert256/sneekie](https://github.com/herbert256/sneekie). Code
comments carry the original BASIC line numbers so the lineage stays legible.

## Build & run

```sh
cargo run --release                            # boot menu: pick mode + movement
cargo run --release -- --classic --turn-based  # the 1988 feel
cargo run --release -- --plus --live           # survival, always gliding
cargo run --release -- --auto                  # watch the bot play
cargo run --release -- --auto --plus           # watch the bot survive the swarm
cargo run --release -- --auto --plus --planner-cores 8  # parallel MCTS
cargo run --release -- --theme amber
cargo run --release --features audio -- --plus # with real square-wave sound
```

Needs an **80×25** (or larger) terminal. If the window is too small it'll ask
you to enlarge it.

## Two axes: mode × movement

Launching with no flags shows a two-step CP437 boot menu. You pick a **mode**
and a **movement style**, independently — four combinations in all (or `A` for
autoplay, below).

**Mode** (`--classic` / `--plus`):
- **Classic** — no hunters; just clear the hearts.
- **Sneekie+** — survival mode with hunters (below).

**Movement** (`--turn-based` / `--live`):
- **Turn-based** — the snake steps once per keypress. In Sneekie+ the hunters
  move in lockstep with you, one step each time you step — pure tactical chess.
- **Live** — the snake is always gliding (the modern snake feel). In Sneekie+
  the hunters step on every glide-tick.

(With only one axis given as a flag, the other defaults sensibly: `--plus`
implies live, `--classic` implies turn-based.)

### Sneekie+ survival mode

Sneekie+ is a **wave system** layered over the level: a cycle between calm
heart-collecting and a "zombie" swarm.

- **Grace period.** Each wave opens calm — smileys are static `−50` traps and
  the field keeps seeding faces as you eat. **Bank as many points as you can**;
  the clock is shown on the spare bottom row. Grace is generous for the first
  wave (**25s**) and **tightens every cycle** (the swarm returns faster), down
  to an 8s floor.
- **The swarm wakes.** When the timer expires, the nearest smileys become
  **hunters** (`☻`, glowing red), the rest clear out, and **no new faces spawn**.
  Hunters step one cell toward your head on **every move** you make (in
  lockstep, if you're playing turn-based). Walls block them — use cover.
- **Banked points are your shield.** A hunter touching you — or you ramming one —
  **costs points and removes that hunter**, *if you can afford it* (the price is
  shown as "ram-kills" you can buy). Can't pay? It's death. So the danger phase
  is a race: keep eating faster than the hunters can reach you.
- **A score multiplier** climbs while the swarm is loose — ×2 the moment they
  wake, +1 each second — scaling the points you earn (not what you pay).
- **Clear the wave** (defeat every hunter) and you earn a breather: faces return,
  the multiplier resets, and a fresh — shorter — clock counts down to the next
  wave. Survive the cycles long enough to clear all the hearts and finish the
  level.

The field is thinned in Sneekie+ (vs. classic's dense scatter) so a level is
actually winnable under the pressure. Press **`m`** to toggle sound.

Balance lives in named constants at the top of `src/game/plus.rs`
(`GRACE_BASE`/`GRACE_STEP`/`GRACE_MIN`, `HUNTERS_MAX`, `HUNTER_COST`,
`WAVE_FACES`) and `glide_speed` in `src/game/play.rs` — easy to dial.

### Autoplay (the bot / screensaver)

`--auto` (or `A` in the menu, which then asks classic or Sneekie+) hands the
snake to a bot that plays — and, with its auto-restart, basically turns Sneekie
into a weird little screensaver (locked to glorious CGA color).

It picks a **brain** per tick to suit the situation — several cores of modern
compute thrown at an 8086 GW-BASIC game:

**Beam planner — the static maze levels** (classic, and the Sneekie+ grace
period before the swarm wakes). Each replan snapshots the board into a throwaway
`Sim` and runs a budget-capped **beam search** over move sequences, rolling each
candidate forward and scoring the result by — in priority order — food eaten,
**smileys eaten** (a cost, see below), whether the head can still reach its tail,
distance to the nearest heart, and open space. It commits to the best plan and
executes it tick-by-tick (at full speed, not game-tick speed), bailing out after
a fixed number of simulated steps. Every committed move passes a **hard
tail-safety gate**, so the planner supplies the routing while a proven one-ply
check supplies the never-self-trap guarantee.

**MCTS — the Sneekie+ danger phase**, when the swarm is loose. Hunters are a
quasi-adversary, but because no new faces spawn while they hunt, their motion is
*deterministic* given the snake's moves — so it can be searched. This is
**Monte-Carlo Tree Search in the AlphaGo mould**, minus the learned nets: PUCT
selection, a hand-rolled **policy prior** (a softmax over food-proximity and
hunter-distance) standing in for the policy network, and **hunter-aware
rollouts** scored by survival-and-eating standing in for the value network. The
rollout simulates the swarm forward exactly (the same one-step-toward-the-head
chase rule the live game uses), so a cell that's safe now but lethal in three
moves is seen as lethal. It returns one move per tick and replans from scratch
the next — the swarm has moved, after all.

The MCTS is **root-parallel**: `--planner-cores N` (or `+`/`-` live while it
plays; the danger-phase HUD shows cores + tree nodes searched) grows N
independent trees from the same root, each with its own seeded ε-greedy rollouts
*and* per-worker root noise so they deepen **different** first-move lines, then
merges their visit counts. The default reserves a couple of hardware threads.

There's a real lesson in the tuning here. With **shallow** search, more cores do
nothing: each per-move decision has a branching factor of ≤3, so one core's MCTS
already saturates it and the extra trees just agree. The compute only pays once
it's spent on **depth** — long rollouts (100-move horizon) and root-diversified
deep lines. Measured on the level-2 swarm, same wall-clock per move: 1 core lost
3 lives over the danger phase; 8 cores lost 1. Breadth saturates; depth scales —
which is the whole point of throwing several modern cores at an 8086 snake.

**Take the penalty if it's the only way through.** Smileys (`−50`) are not walls
to the planner — they're passable *at a cost*. If the only route to the remaining
hearts runs through a smiley, the bot eats it and moves on (a heart is worth far
more than a smiley costs); if there's a clean path, it takes that instead. The
same logic governs ramming hunters in Sneekie+ — pay the cost when it buys a way
forward. **And if there's no winning line at all, that's a draw**: the bot gives
up the level and respawns (F10 skip in classic — no life lost; **ESC** in
Sneekie+ — a life given up, fair and square) rather than thrashing forever.

When neither planner is in charge — the moving-arrow levels (whose hazards aren't
modeled yet), or when a search turns up nothing safe — a per-tick **greedy chain**
takes over: BFS to the nearest food if the step stays tail-safe → ram an adjacent
hunter it can afford → chase its own tail to thread out of a pocket → else head
for the most open space. A short **move-history ring** also breaks repeating
cycles, and two **stall/wedge guards** (no score gain for a long stretch, or the
head not actually moving for several ticks) trigger the give-up-and-respawn above
so the screensaver never freezes.

Result: effectively immortal on the static classic levels, cycling through the
layouts indefinitely in CGA color; a fair, go-down-swinging run in Sneekie+.
Moving enemies (arrows, hunters) can still corner it — and that's fine, it just
restarts. Watch it play either mode (`--auto`, `--auto --plus`, or the menu's
`A`). Ctrl+C to quit. (`AUTO_STALL` in `src/game/autoplay/mod.rs` tunes patience;
`PLAN_BUDGET`/`PLAN_DEPTH`/`BEAM_WIDTH` in `planner.rs` and `MCTS_SIMS` in
`mcts.rs` tune how hard the two planners think.)

## How to play

Eat every `♥` heart to clear a level (plus every `♣` club from level 17 on).
There are 32 levels across 8 maze layouts; the back 16 add moving hazards and
auto-advancing speed.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow keys | Steer the snake |
| `ESC` | Give up a life when you're stuck |
| `m` | Toggle sound (Sneekie+) |
| any key | Continue at a prompt |
| `1`–`4` | Switch theme live (Green / Amber / White / CGA) |
| `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

Scoring: `♥` +10, `♣` +25, `☺` **−50** (avoid these!), `◙` pushable stone.
A per-level **Bonus** ticks down as you play and is added to your score when you
clear the level. Highscore, theme, and mute state persist to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sneekie/state` (`~/.config/sneekie/state`).

> There may also be a couple of function keys that do… helpful things. Shh.

## Themes

`hercules` (green), `amber`, `white`, `cga` (the colorized default). Pass with
`--theme <name>`, or press `1`–`4` at any prompt.

## Project layout

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/main.rs` | Bootstrap: argument parsing, save path, help |
| `src/cp437.rs` | CP437 → Unicode table (the charset) |
| `src/theme.rs` | Color themes + CGA colorizer |
| `src/game/mod.rs` | The "machine": VRAM, CRT renderer, keyboard, BASIC output primitives |
| `src/game/layouts.rs` | The eight maze builders (`lay*`) |
| `src/game/enemies.rs` | The moving hazards (`sub*`) |
| `src/game/play.rs` | Level loop, movement, death, boot sequence |
| `src/game/plus.rs` | Sneekie+ survival mode and the boot menu |
| `src/game/autoplay/` | The self-driving bot — `mod.rs` (dispatch + safety gates + stall/wedge guards), `greedy.rs` (reactive fallback chain), `planner.rs` (bounded beam search), `mcts.rs` (MCTS vs. the swarm), `sim.rs` (forward-model) |
| `src/game/audio.rs` | Square-wave synth (behind the `audio` feature) |

Classic Sneekie is fully preserved: every Sneekie+ hook in `play.rs` is guarded
by `self.plus`, and the score multiplier is a no-op (`mult == 1`) outside the
danger phase, so classic mode runs byte-identically to the pure port.

## Notes

- **Audio** is opt-in via the `audio` Cargo feature (rodio). The default build
  is dependency-free and silent; `--features audio` adds real square-wave tones
  through the existing `snd()` hooks, queued in sequence just like the original
  `SOUND` statements. Building with the feature needs ALSA dev headers on Linux
  (`pacman -S alsa-lib`); if no audio device is found at runtime the game falls
  back to silent.
